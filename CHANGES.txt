Conversion timeout can now be configured via command line option `--timeout`.
This is useful for files that take a long time to convert, so that the server
runs into a timeout exception.

When writing converted files to an output directory their file extensions are
now changed to .pdf, like in `file.docx -> pdfa/file.pdf`. This does not apply
to single output files specified by the --output option.
